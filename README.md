# Pattern Searching Tool

The Pattern Searching Tool is a web-based application that demonstrates the use of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Rabin-Karp algorithms. It utilized both algorithms to efficiently search for patterns within a given text string. This tool allows you to input a text string and a search string, and it highlights all occurrences of the search string within the text string.
